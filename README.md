This is a simple web service application build for my HPE Forage Experience.

I am building an RESTful API which manages a list of employees with the end goal of supporting HTTPS GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE commands.

All code is written in Java, and I am using SpringBoot to help me create the service.

Through this project I have learnt how RESTful APIs work as well as how to build and deploy them, both of which are industry grade skills that I can implement in a future career
